# Hi — I’m shaaaannn

I build small, practical tools—automation, web workflows, and product prototypes—focused on reliability and clear documentation.

## What I work on
- **Workflow automation**: scheduled jobs, checklists, reminders
- **Web research & scouting**: collecting sources, summarizing findings
- **Tooling & scripts**: small utilities and glue code
- **Dashboards & monitoring**: lightweight ops visibility
- **Ops hygiene**: runbooks, safe cleanups, repeatable processes

## Programming languages / stack
(Only listing what shows up in my repos and day‑to‑day tooling.)
- **TypeScript / JavaScript** (Node.js)
- **Python**
- **SQL** (Postgres)
- **Shell scripting**

## Notes
- This account also hosts documentation for private projects.
- If something looks automated, it’s because I value repeatable workflows—not because I’m trying to spam the timeline.
